<h1>Background Page</h1>
<p>
  My name is MaKayla Clark, I am a North Carolina native and an aspiring web developer. I attended UNCW for 2 1/2 years for a degree in Computer Science. With my background and interests, it was never clear until I enrolled in college, what I was going to do with my life.
    From journalism and creative writing to social work and microbiology, my want for my career and life after my time in academia ended. I was first introduced to Computer Science in middle school, as the first group of students to test out a new STEM program. I have always
    been a good student, but I never flourished as fast as I did when we began our unit on coding. Personally mentored by my computing teacher and subsequently recommended to attend a computing camp the summer before high school. It would take until 3rd year of high school, 
    many failed career assessments, and the pandemic before I decided I wanted to have a career in computer science.

    I was searching for a path that would allow me freedom, growth, and the ability to make a tangible change with the actions I carried out. Along with that, seeing the reaction and fallout that came with the shutdown and how many things went virtual, 
    and how many places were unprepared, I eventually decided that computer science was the profession for me. The creative freedom to think freely about how to complete a task, the ability to learn and grow with a constantly evolving field, and the ability 
    to make user-friendly, accessibile and vital systems and applications is the driving force that keeps me dedicated to my current passion of computer science.
