        Hi, I'm MaKayla Clark, a web developer from North Carolina. I am unable to say that my career path was a straight line, but every twist has made me more well-rounded and stronger in my conviction as a web developer. I spent two and a half years at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, pursuing a Computer Science degree.
        Throughout my life, I explored a range of interests, from journalism and creative writing to social work and microbiology. It wasnâ€™t until I was enrolling in college that I realized computer science was where I truly belonged.
    </p>

    <p> I was first introduced to computing in middle school through a new STEM program. I quickly excelled in coding and was mentored by my teacher, even attending a computing camp before high school. 
        However, it took years of career exploration, including many failed assessments and a pandemic, before I truly embraced this path.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I was drawn to computer science because it offers creative freedom, endless opportunities for growth, and the ability to create meaningful, accessible technology. Seeing how the world shifted during the pandemic highlighted the importance of trustworthy systems and sparked my desire to make a real-world change. 
        Now, my goal is to develop user-friendly and innovative applications that make a difference.
